		<p> Hardware Operation and Management Max-Planck-Institut far extraterrestrische Physik, 2010 - Present I carried out operation and maintenance of a near-infrared/optical detector (GROND) located at the Max-Planck-Gesselschaft 2.2 meter telescope, in Chile. I have been a part of over 35 new discoveries. I travelled frequently to the instrument in Chile to make observations, which has amounted to 3528 hours of experience. I am an integral member of four projects, within international groups, that have acquired time at a world leading telescope facility, involving a range of instruments (e.g. spectrometer VIMOS, radio array ATCA, and CCD camera HAWK-I, to name but a few). I schedule the astronomical targets to be observed and delegate the duties to other members of the operating team, consisting of post-doctoral research fellows, PhD students and Masters students. I was the principle investigator (lead scientist) of three projects utilising the near-infrared detector HAWK-I located at the Very Large Telescope. </p>
		<p> Software Development Max-Planck-Institut far extraterrestrische Physik, 2010 - Present â€” I have developed new software to allow displays located at the telescope site to be viewed remotely in real-time. This is important as real-time usage is not viable remotely. The software consists of a mixture of bash scripts and Python, whereby the images are eventually presented on an internal group web page. This is utilised by our group when carrying out observations. </p>
